OpenForecast is a package of general purpose, forecasting models written in Java that can be applied to any data series. One of the design goals is to make it easy for a developer to use in an application even if they do not understand, or care to understand, the differences between the different forecasting models available.

Requirements
============

To build OpenForecast, you will need the following tools:

 - a Java compiler (works with J2SDK 1.3 and above)
 - Ant 1.5 or later (earlier versions may work too)


Building OpenForecast
=====================

Using ant, the available targets are as follows:

   compile  Compiles core library source files
   test     Compile and run the tests
   examples Compiles example source files
   docs     Generates javadocs
   dist     Builds files for distribution
   clean    Removes all temporary and build files
   usage    Displays this usage information

Note that with version OpenForecast 0.4.0, the default is to make the targets: compile, test. That is, to compile all source files, then build and run all the test cases.
